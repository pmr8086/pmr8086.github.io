<p>For us to be able to fine tune the controller, we need to know more about the system we're trying to control in the first place.</p>

<h4>Coil Frequency Response</h4>

<p>The galvanometer coil DC resistance had been measured to be 400 &Omega;. But it could be useful to know its inductance too. This was my first choice of measurement since it seemed to be pretty easy, and for some reason I expected it to be significant. Ultimately though the opposite was the case; it took me a while to get it right (pretty frustrating), and the corrections obtained are negligible for our purposes.</p>

<p>First I regarded the coil as a resistance $R$ in series with an inductance $L$. The value of $R$ we knew to be 400 &Omega; from DC measurements. If we placed the coil in series with a known test resistance $R_{\rm test}$, then at frequency $\nu$, we'd have

$$
|Z|^2 = (R+R_{\rm test})^2 + (2\pi\nu L)^2
$$

where $Z$ is the impedance of the whole circuit. If the circuit is driven by a voltage $V$ at frequency $\nu$, and $V_{\rm test}$ is the voltage across the test resistor, then

$$
|Z| = \frac{|V|}{|I|} = \frac{|V|}{|V_{\rm test}|}R_{\rm test}
$$

This was appropriate because only one channel in the oscilloscope was working, and so we could not measure phase, only magnitude. To measure $L$ then, drive the circuit with a sinusoid of known amplitude $|V|$ and frequency $\nu$, measure $|V_{\rm test}|$, and use the two equations.</p>

<p>Here are the results of one battery of such tests:</p>

(Rtest = 330 &Omega;)
&nu;		|Z|		L

<p>Clearly something's wrong. I performed several such measurements, with frequencies ranging from 100s of Hz to a few MHz, with different values for $R_{\rm test}$, and later then even other circuit arrangements, until I gave up on this "series RL" model for the coil. I briefly considered other coil models (one with a parallel capacitor to account for winding capacitance for example), but then I realized we didn't really need any model; we could just regard the coil as an "abstract" 2nd order system. And, even more importantly, we just had to measure its step response to deduce all its properties.</p>

<p>Now I placed the coil in series with a 10 k&Omega; resistor, applied a 500 mV step to the circuit, and measured the voltage across the coil; the result is the picture in the top left. I didn't like it that much, and so I added a 10 nF cap in parallel with the coil to make things smoother, resulting in the remaining three pictures.</p>

<p>From the knowledge that the height of the step is 500 mV &times; 400 &Omega; 10400 &Omega; = 500 mV / 26 = 19.23 mV, and that in the last (bottom right) picture there is 10 &mu;s per horizontal division, we find the following expression for the voltage $y$ across the coil as a function of time:

$$
y(t) = 19.23\,{\rm mV} \cdot (1 + 1.26 \cdot e^{-t\cdot 30\,{\rm kHz}}-2.26 e^{-t\cdot122\,{\rm kHz}})
$$

This expression can be found for example by looking at the coordinates of the critical point $\dot y=0$. Now take the Laplace transform and divide both sides by the transformed input step

$$
X(s) = \frac{500 \, {\rm mV}}s
$$

to obtain

\begin{align}
T(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} &amp;= \frac1{26}\cdot\left(1+\frac{1.26s}{s+30\,{\rm kHz}}-\frac{2.26s}{s+122\,{\rm kHz}}\right) \\
&amp;= \frac{(9.15\,{\rm kHz})(s+15.38\,{\rm kHz})}{(s+30\,{\rm kHz})(s+122\,{\rm kHz})}
\end{align}

Now, to get the galvanometer's impedance $Z$, write

$$
T = \frac{Z'}{Z'+R}
\qquad
Z' = Z \parallel (sC)^{-1}
\qquad
{
	{R = 10 \, {\rm k\Omega}}
	\atop
	{C = 10 \, {\rm nF}}
}
$$

to obtain

$$
Z = Z' \parallel (-sC)^{-1}
\qquad
Z' = \frac R{\frac1T-1}
$$

$$
Z = 1.08\,{\rm k\Omega} \cdot \frac{(1 \,{\rm MHz})(s+15.38\,{\rm kHz})}{(s+1.49\,{\rm MHz})(s+28\,{\rm kHz})}
$$

It can be seen now how $Z$ cannot be realized by a series RL in parallel with a series RC nor a series RL in parallel with a cap either, for example. The former has two (finite) zeros, as opposed to one for $Z$, and in the latter, the two zeros must be additive inverses of one another. The following expression may be found, however

$$
\frac1Z = \frac1{720\,{\rm\Omega}} + \frac1{890\,{\rm\Omega}+s\cdot58\,{\rm mH}}+s\cdot926\,{\rm pF}
$$

which does suggest a circuit equivalent. It would be interesting to see if this value $L = 58 \,{\rm mH}$ is supported by other inductance measurements (for example, relating magnetic field and coil current).</p>

<p>At this point it's interesting to test the formula obtained for $Z$ against our experiments. For example, below we have compared the values of $|330\,\Omega+Z|$ calculated from the formula and obtained from the experiment we mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>I'd say that's a good agreement.</p>
